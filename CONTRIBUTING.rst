1. **Unit tests**, **documentation**, and **code style** are in order. 
   
   It's also OK to submit work in progress if you're unsure of what
   this exactly means, in which case you'll likely be asked to make
   some further changes.

2. The contributed code will be **licensed under spectrum's license** (BSD3),
   If you did not write the code yourself, you ensure the existing
   license is compatible and include the license information in the
