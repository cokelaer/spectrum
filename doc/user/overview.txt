**Spectrum** contains tools to estimate Power Spectral Densities using methods based on Fourier transform, Parametric methods or eigenvalues analysis:

    * The Fourier methods are based upon correlogram, periodogram and Welch estimates. Standard tapering windows (Hann, Hamming, Blackman) and more exotic ones are available (DPSS, Taylor, ...). 
    * The parametric methods are based on Yule-Walker, BURG, MA and ARMA, covariance and modified covariance methods.
    * Non-parametric methods based on eigen analysis (e.g., MUSIC) and minimum variance analysis are also implemented.
